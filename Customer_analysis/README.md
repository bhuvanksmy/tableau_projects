# Customer Analysis Project
# Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a product-based dataset to derive meaningful insights. The dataset used for this analysis and visualization is [./Customer_analysis/sales_dataset_FY2020-21.csv]. This dataset contains various pieces of information relevant to customer purchases and product sales.

# Types of Charts
The dashboard leverages a variety of charts to present data in an intuitive and informative manner:

- Butterfly Chart: Used to compare two related variables side-by-side.
- Donut Chart: Displays the proportion of categories within a whole.
- Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between two variables.
- Bar Chart: Compares different categories of data.
- Geospatial Maps: Visualizes data across different geographical locations.
  
# Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders for this project are:

- Marketing Teams: To understand customer behavior and preferences.
- Business Teams: To make data-driven decisions and strategize accordingly.
  
# Tools and Skills Used
- Tableau Desktop: For creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
- Hierarchy: To organize data in a structured manner.
- Calculated Columns: For performing complex calculations and deriving new metrics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To identify patterns, anomalies, and insights within the data.
  
# Insights
The analysis provides several key insights:

- Revenue by State: Identifies which states generate the most revenue.
- Revenue by Month: Shows the revenue trends over different months.
- Payment by Types: Analyzes the distribution of payment methods used by customers.
- Revenue per Category per Gender: Breaks down revenue by product categories and gender of customers.
- Percentage of Revenue by Region: Calculates the contribution of each region to the total revenue.
- Revenue by Age: Examines how revenue varies across different age groups.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and visualize data effectively using Tableau. By employing various types of charts and conducting thorough EDA, I have provided actionable insights for marketing and business teams. These insights can help in understanding customer behavior, optimizing sales strategies, and improving overall business performance
